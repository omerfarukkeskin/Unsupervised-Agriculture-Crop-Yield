# Unsupervised-Agriculture-Crop-YieldSupervised-Agriculture-Crop-Yield

This project used the K-Means Clustering algorithm to understand agricultural crop yield and the relationship between temperature and crop yield. The dataset includes the yield per hectare of agricultural products (Yield_tons_per_hectare) and other environmental factors. Within the scope of the project, operations were carried out especially on temperature (Temperature_Celsius) and yield (Yield_tons_per_hectare) data.

K-Means Clustering was chosen to partition the observations in the dataset into groups with similar characteristics. The analysis focused on the Temperature_Celsius and Yield_tons_per_hectare columns, aiming to better understand the relationships between these two variables. To evaluate the effectiveness of this model, the distribution and characteristics of the resulting clusters were visualized. The K-Means algorithm enabled a clearer understanding of the relationships between temperature and yield, contributing to the development of agricultural strategies. Therefore, K-Means was an appropriate choice for discovering similarities and groups within the dataset.


The columns in the dataset are:

Soil_Type: Soil Type

Crop: Crop Planted

Rainfall_mm: Amount of Rainfall (mm)

Temperature_Celsius: Temperature (Â°C)

Fertilizer_Used: Amount of Fertilizer Used

Irrigation_Used: Irrigation Amount

Weather_Condition: Weather

Days_to_Harvest: Number of Days Until Harvest

Yield_tons_per_hectare: Crop Yield per Hectare
